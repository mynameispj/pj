		<h2>My name is PJ McCormick. I'm a web designer and developer and, as of June 8, 2012, a</h2> 
		<h1>Cancer Survivor</h1>
		<p class="date">Posted: June 13, 2012</p>
		<p>On Friday, June 8, 2012, we learned that I have testicular cancer.</p>
		<p>At the moment, a lot is still very much up in the air. If I'm lucky, the cancer will claim only this one (very treasured) piece of my body. If I'm not, and the cancer has spread, then any number of surgeries and chemo- and radiotherapies are in my future.</p>
		<p>I am terrified, of course. Lately I've felt scared about everything.</p>
		<p>But I am also aware that I am very lucky. Not only to have contracted such a treatable cancer, but to be held up by the love of my incredible wife&mdash;who, in spite of her own pain and fear over this has taken amazing care of me and shown unbelievable strength and courage&mdash;and the support of an incredible circle of family and friends.</p>
		<h3>People have been asking if they can help. The good news is that, yes, they can.</h3>

				<h2>Make a donation in my honor</h2>
				<p>Take whatever amount you can comfortably spare right now&mdash;even the measy 5 bucks you were going to spend on coffee makes a huge difference&mdash;and donate it to the LiveStrong foundation in my honor. Not only are they an incredible organization, they have been a source of comfort and guidance to me in this difficult time.</p>
