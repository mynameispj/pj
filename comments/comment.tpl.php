 *   hide($content['field_example']) to temporarily suppress the printing of a
 *   given element.
 * - $created: Formatted date and time for when the comment was created.
 *   Preprocess functions can reformat it by calling format_date() with the
 *   desired parameters on the $comment->created variable.

 *   desired parameters on the $comment->changed variable.

 *   - comment-by-anonymous: Comment by an unregistered user.
 *   - comment-by-node-author: Comment by the author of the parent node.

 *   modules, intended to be displayed after the main title tag that appears in
 *   the template.
